Problem 1:
Root of f(x) is 0.5
intervals outside the root lead to expected error

Problem 2:

Second function does not find a root between 0 and 2 since the root at 1 has an even multiplicity and no sign change. this is expected 

Problem 3:

all fixed points are verified at 7^1/5

The functions that don't converge have behaviors that lead the fixed point calculation to higher and higher values in each iteration, which eventually leads to overflow errors.
this probably has to do with the derivative of f(x)
